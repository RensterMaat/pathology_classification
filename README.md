# pathology_classification
Whole-slide image classification based on preextracted features.

This repository provides tools to tessalate whole-slide images, extract features using pretrained models and to train a classifier based on these preextracted features. Its functionality is divided into three steps:
1. Tessalate: take a whole-slide image and split it into a square, non-overlapping patches.
2. Extract: extract features using a pretrained feature extractor.
3. Hyperparameter sweep: explore configurations of hyperparameters to find optimal settings for the final classifier.
4. Evaluate: train and evaluate a model on the supplied dataset.
